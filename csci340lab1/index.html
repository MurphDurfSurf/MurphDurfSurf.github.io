            <h3 class="italic">a dish of meat or vegetables (or both) cooked slowly in liquid in a closed dish or pan.</h3>
            <p>I am quite fond of stew. It has its merits in the simple fact that it is, funnily enough, simple. Stew has been the backbone
                of many peoples dinners, suppers, and maybe even breakfasts throughout history. It can be anything the heart desires, from beef to
                chicken to vegetarian. It is the ultimate idea of what food is, a mixture of ingredients that by themselves are not much, but when
                combined and cooked together become something greater than the sum of their parts. A good stew melts the heart and warms the soul.
